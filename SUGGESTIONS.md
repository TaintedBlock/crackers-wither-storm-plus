# Suggestion guidelines


I don't mind taking suggestions, but, there are a few suggestions that people have mentioned I'd like to NOT have to continue denying.
I also like being able to see what people want changed, or want to be added. I want to be able to make CWSPLUS the best it can be.



##Duplicates

-Try not to make duplicate bug reports or feature requests. Because whatever you may be reporting or suggestion could have been answered already.  


## Story Mode suggestions

1. Tentacle attacks
-I don't plan on adding this. Its not like I could anyway. CWSPLUS is not about making it like Story Mode. 

2. More armors/Story Mode armors
-This is definitely out of the question. I have no intention on adding these as there is no point. There is also already tons of mods that add them.
