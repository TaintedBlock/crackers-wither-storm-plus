# Suggestion guidelines


I don't mind taking suggestions, but, there are a few suggestions that people have mentioned I'd like to NOT have to continue denying.
I also like being able to see what people want changed, or want to be added. I want to be able to make CWSPLUS the best it can be.



## Duplicates

1. Try not to make duplicate bug reports or feature requests. Because whatever you may be reporting or suggestion could have been answered already.  


## Story Mode suggestions

1. Tentacle attacks

   I don't plan on adding this. Its not like I could anyway. CWSPLUS is not about making it like Story Mode. 

2. More armors/Story Mode armors

   This is definitely out of the question. I have no intention on adding these as there is no point. There is also already tons of mods that add them.

3. Bowels Flipping
   This is not possible due to how the bowels are made in CWSM, and I do not plan on making custom bowels.
